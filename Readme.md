# Slidy2

This is an archive for a slide viewer from the W3C.org so I could create presentations based on scalar vector graphics (SVG) which were very attractive but slightly ahead of the technology curve.

## Why?

The browser technology I had access to (firefox) which showed an irritating white splash when the slide was loaded but before the SVG rendering was done.

## Why not?

I kept this copy but haven't tried to keep it updated.  Hope it can help you, but you probably want to take a look at the code before checking the source for newer technology.
